Some notes

2/24
  - switch the array that is tracking what goes to the display to a [String] again.
  - then convert the Strings to Ints for calculation.
  - this will get rid of the issue of two digit numbers throwing of theCount
  - get rid of theCount...its stupid
  
2/25
  Goal is 223+48
  1. Button push 2
    a. Append a 2 to display      ->  display:String = "2"
    b. Increase theCount by 1     ->  theCount:Int = 1
  2. Button push 2
    a. Append a 2 to display      ->  display:String = "22"
    b. Increase theCount by 1     ->  theCount:Int = 2
  3. Button push 3
    a. Append a 3 to display      ->  display:Stirng = "223"
    b. Increase theCount by 1     ->  theCount:Int = 3
  4. Button push +
    a. Append a + to the display                    -> display:String = "223+"
    b. firstValue = display.subString(0, theCount)  -> firstValue:Int = 223
    c. reset theCount                               -> theCount = 0
    d. Set add:Bool to true                         -> add:Bool = true
  5. Button push 4
    a. Append a 4 to display      -> display:String = "223+4"
    b. Button push = secondValue  -> secondValue:String = "4"
  6. Button push 8   
    a. Append an 8 to display     -> display:String = "223+48"
    b. Append to buttonPush       -> secondValue = "48"
  7. Button push = or + or - ect
    a. Since add is true then add firstValue and secondValue and store as answer
    b. Clear display and send answer to it
    c. reset add to false
    d. reset everything else
    e. if +-x/ pushed then store answer as firstValue
    f. Otherwise start over

2/26

  - When one number is added to another the + sign shows up but disappears once the second number is pushed.
  - When more than one number is pressed and then the + sign is pushed the + sign never shows up.
  - Calculations on single digit numbers works.
  - Multi digit numbers can't be used for calculations.
  
2/27

  - Current Issues are as follows
    - 2nd round of calculations don't work
    - This is a result of the substring() function receiving nil.
